## Coding Guidelines

In addition to the following guidelines, please follow the conventions already established in the code.

- **Spacing**:<br>
  Use two spaces for indentation. No tabs.

- **Naming**:<br>
  Keep variable & method names concise & descriptive.<br>
  Variable names `index`, `collection`, & `callback` are preferable to `i`, `arr`, & `fn`.

- **Quotes**:<br>
  Single-quoted strings are preferred to double-quoted strings; however, please use a double-quoted string if the value contains a single-quote character to avoid unnecessary escaping.

- **Comments**:<br>
  Please use single-line comments to annotate significant additions, & [JSDoc-style](http://www.2ality.com/2011/08/jsdoc-intro.html) comments for new methods.
